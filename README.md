# myBudgetApp
This is a budget app where you can add, delete, or swap (by dragging and dropping) budget items. This app utilizes local storage and budget information entered into the table will still be available on page reload.

To use the app, enter your budget item description, cost, category, and date. The following data entry will result in error, so please avoid doing the following: repeating item descriptions, incorrectly formatting cost (must be formatted as x.xx such as 9.00 rather than 9), and incorrectly formatting date (must be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY). 

The app can be accessed here: https://mybudgetappforanyone.netlify.com/
